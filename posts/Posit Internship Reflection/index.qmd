I spent the summer working for Posit (formerly known as RStudio), and I loved it. I was on the tinytools squad, as an intern for **Great Tables**, the Python port of {gt} in R. My team was responsible for many of the major ports from Posit's R packages to Python. This is certainly an incomplete list, but they've created the Python version of {ggplot2}, {pointblank}, {scales}, {forcats}, {dplyr}, and {reactable}, to name a few.

## What I Did

The technical work at first largely consisted of work on my own package, an addition to the Great Tables ecosystem by way of extension. But I was able to contribute directly to Great Tables as well, which was very satisfying. And then there was the unexpected third avenue of work involving the presentation and promotion of my work to engage with the broader open source community (which was very scary).

I also got to meet tons of folks from the wider Posit community, courtesy of internal weekly matchmaking and fun talks/hangouts. The list of wonderful people I've crossed paths with in these last few months is longer than I have room for. Suffice to say that from intern hangouts to coffee chats with Posit developers in Europe, to career advice with former python open source team members, to data science talks, the remote world has not been all too remote.

### gt-extras

If you're here I'll assume you know about the [**gt-extras**](https://posit-dev.github.io/gt-extras/) package, or at the very least you know who I am, so I'll avoid the shameless plug. The overwhelming majority of my work this summer has entailed a port of the {gtExtras} R package to Python, a task that was made more complex and interesting because of the underlying differences between the R and Python versions of Great Tables.

The core tasks of the gt-extras library are to:

1.  make existing features of Great Tables easier to use
2.  add in-cell plotting
3.  compose styles to replicate the look of famous publications

Rich Iannone (one of my mentors) got me started with the package structure, since he had written a version one of themes

<!-- todo -->
Michael Chow (my other mentor) 

Over the first couple of weeks, I met with both daily, and later we made longer term targets and paired for the more critical decisions. One of which was the first external contribution into my package, which was a delight to see. For the most part, I was given low-level autonomy over implementation choices, and reserved advice for decisions like how to approach building plots or how to unify competing underlying dataframes (looking at you, Narwhals ðŸ‘€). The control was nice, as it helped me learn what I could do myself, even when at first it felt like a good thing to ask for help on (like designing the documentation website).

Okay, fine â€“ I can't help but show off some of the cool things it can do. We can see a summary of the 2011 NFL season, my favorite being the winloss charts, primarily because of how much winning my New York Giants did that season.

### Great Tables

The very first PR I made to Great Tables was an entirely new feature, to rotate column labels 90 degrees. I don't think I realized it at the time, but the workflow of that task was exactly how I approached the functions in gt-extras. Namely, I had to write a function, write a docstring with an example, add it to the documentation, and then write tests. This last part kind of grew on me, even though I'd embarrassingly never really done it before.

### Package Promotion

It seems obvious now, but I had never thought about what happens to a package after we write it. It's a good thing I had Michael and Rich pushing me through this step because, had it been up to me, the world would never have learned about this package. Talking about the package doesn't come easy to me, especially when it's to an audience of more than just my roommate, but it really helped that the team gave me the first boost (and it certainly didn't hurt to have the Posit organization promoting it too).

And selfishly I must admit the effect of broadcasting the package far and wide is rewarding. Seeing the package featured on a blog post, or used in someone's repository will make my day. Becasue it's so cool to know the design choices I stayed awake thinking about were (possibly) appreciated by a fellow data enthusiast.

## What I Learned

<!-- todo -->
This summer touched on so many aspects of open source code

### Package Development

### Development Organization

With a little shame, I must admit I never knew how to use a branch. That's an exaggeration. I knew what a branch _was_, and I knew to make one so I didn't have to commit to the main branch. The shameful part is once I had a branch, all the new code went into that. (ðŸ™ˆ Don't look at the repository for this website). And then one day, when I felt like there was probably too much code I hadn't commited to the main branch, I'd merge it and ta-da, surely that was good enough... right?


<!-- todo -->
With even more shame, I have to admit I didn't know how to write a suite of tests.

When I say I've learned to do these things, I don't mean I'm a pro. I mean with the mentoring of Rich and Michael, I am now much _better_ at adhering these practices than I used to be.


### Writing things like this!

<!-- add link to posit blog post -->
Whether it's a blog post for me (this one!), a blog [post](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/plots-in-tables/) for Great Tables or a blog post for the entirety of Posit, I have had no shortage of oppotunites to talk about myself. As you might guess, this doesn't come naturally to me, but it's yet another skill I've gotten to practice and hone in my summer at Posit.

In every instance (yes, even the slides), my musings are presented with the help of Quarto markdown. I promise I'm not getting paid to say this, but having never used Quarto before this summer, I can confidently say I can't imagine a life without it. Life with Quarto was especially easy when the team that maintains it was part of the organization I worked for :) something I'll definitely miss. Instead, you'll find me lurking in GitHub issues.

## What's Next (It's Not Over Yet)

At the time of publication, I still have a few weeks remaining in my time at Posit. Big things are still planned, from more features in gt-extras, to upgrades for Great Tables. Stick around here or give [**gt-extas**](https://github.com/posit-dev/gt-extras) a star and follow along with my work there.
