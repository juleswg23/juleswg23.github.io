    "text": "What I Learned\n\nPackage Development\n\n\nDevelopment Organization\nWith a little shame, I must admit I never knew how to use a branch. Thatâ€™s an exaggeration. I knew what a branch was, and I knew to make one so I didnâ€™t have to commit to the main branch. The shameful part is once I had a branch, all the new code went into that. (ðŸ™ˆ Donâ€™t look at the repository for this website). And then one day, when I felt like there was probably too much code I hadnâ€™t commited to the main branch, Iâ€™d merge it and ta-da, surely that was good enoughâ€¦ right?\nWith even more shame, I have to admit I didnâ€™t know how to write a suite of tests.\nWhen I say Iâ€™ve learned to do these things, I donâ€™t mean Iâ€™m a pro. I mean with the mentoring of Rich and Michael, I am now much better at adhering these practices than I used to be.\n\n\nWriting things like this!\nWhether itâ€™s a blog post for me (this one!), a blog post for Great Tables or a blog post for the entirety of Posit, I have had no shortage of oppotunites to talk about myself. As you might guess, this doesnâ€™t come naturally to me, but itâ€™s yet another skill Iâ€™ve gotten to practice and hone in my summer at Posit.\nIn every instance (yes, even the slides), my musings are presented with the help of Quarto markdown. I promise this isnâ€™t an ad, but having never used Quarto before this summer, I can confidently say I canâ€™t imagine a life without it."
