    "text": "I spent the summer working for Posit (formerly known as RStudio), and I loved it. I was on the tinytools squad, as an intern for Great Tables, the Python port of {gt} in R. My team was responsible for many of the major ports from Posit‚Äôs R packages to Python. They are awesome ‚Äì this is certainly an incomplete list, but they‚Äôve created the Python versions of {ggplot2}, {pointblank}, {scales}, {forcats}, {dplyr}, and {reactable}, to name a few."

    "section": "What I Did",
    "text": "What I Did\nThe technical work at first largely consisted of work on my own package, an addition to the Great Tables ecosystem by way of extension. Then I was able to contribute directly to Great Tables as well, which was very satisfying. And then there was the unexpected third avenue of work involving the presentation and promotion of my work to engage with the broader open source community (which was quite scary).\nI also got to meet tons of folks from the wider Posit community, thanks to internal weekly matchmaking, fun talks/hangouts (and even an in-person meetup). I‚Äôve met so many wonderful people over the past few months that I couldn‚Äôt possibly list them all here. Suffice to say that from intern hangouts to coffee chats with Posit developers in Europe, to career advice with former python open source team members, to data science talks, the remote world of my internship has not been all too remote.\n\ngt-extras\nIf you‚Äôre here I‚Äôll assume you know about the gt-extras package, or at the very least you know who I am, so I‚Äôll avoid the shameless plug. The overwhelming majority of my work this summer has entailed a port of the {gtExtras} R package to Python, a task that was made more complex and interesting because of the underlying differences between the R and Python versions of Great Tables.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe core tasks of the gt-extras library are to:\n\nmake existing features of Great Tables easier to use\nadd in-cell plotting\ncompose styles to replicate the themes of famous publications\nexecute simple html and post-processing steps\n\nRich Iannone (one of my great mentors) got me started with the package structure, since he had already written a minimal version with one theme. That class of functions turned out to be the most bang for my buck ‚Äì take the exact styling options researched and implemented by Thomas Mock in {gtExtras}, and with minimal syntax changes I had finished the themes!\nBut it wasn‚Äôt all copy and paste. In fact, after that, just about every function had a pretty critical deviation from the R version. The underlying dataframe in the Python package is different from R, and gtExtras had access to ggplot2, two elements that were inaccessible to me. Since we wanted to keep dependencies light, I did all of the data wrangling and graphics myself.\nMichael Chow (my other great mentor) pointed me towards Narwhals (a library meant for handling different dataframe libraries). Both he and Rich encouraged me to try out different approaches to plotting, and while they could have easily told me ‚Äúdo it this way,‚Äù I am very grateful that I was trusted enough to make those decisions and discoveries myself.\nOver the first couple of weeks, I met with both daily, and later we made longer term targets and paired for the more critical decisions. One of which was the first external contribution into my package, which was a delight to see. For the most part, I was given low-level autonomy over implementation choices, and reserved pairing for decisions like how to approach building plots or how to unify competing underlying dataframes (looking at you, Narwhals üëÄ). The independence was freeing, as it helped me learn what I could do myself, even when at first it felt like a good thing to ask for help on (like designing the documentation website).\nOkay, fine ‚Äì I can‚Äôt help but show off some of the cool things it can do. We can see a summary of the 2011 NFL season, my favorite being the winloss charts, primarily because of how much winning my New York Giants did that season.\n\n\n\nA mega-example built with the gt-extras library\n\n\n\n\nGreat Tables\nThe very first PR I made to Great Tables was an entirely new feature, to rotate column labels 90 degrees. I don‚Äôt think I realized it at the time, but the workflow of that task was exactly how I approached the functions in gt-extras. Namely, I had to write a function, write a docstring with an example, add it to the documentation, and then write tests. This last part kind of grew on me, even though I‚Äôd embarrassingly never really done it before.\nIt didn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äì as I progressed through styling and coloring functions, I uncovered little improvements I wanted to make to Great Tables. The bonus side effect of spending all those hours extending Great Tables is that I became perhaps the most frequent user (and tester) of the package. Eventually, I got to a point where I was fluent enough with Great Tables source code, and tacked some larger features and known bugs. So a number of my own GitHub issues (and my subsequent PRs) made their way into the repository:\n\n\na grand üòâ new feature\na collection of many different fixes to old group bugs\na row striping indexing bug with grouped data\na data coloring palette bug\nan improvement to autocoloring the text of striped rows\nan improvement to autocoloring in semi-transparent elements\n\n\n\nPackage Promotion\nIt seems obvious now, but I had never thought about what happens to a package after we write it. It‚Äôs a good thing I had Michael and Rich pushing me through this step because, had it been up to me, the world would never have learned about this package. Talking about the package doesn‚Äôt come easily to me, especially when it‚Äôs to an audience of more than just my roommate, but it really helped that the team gave me the first boost (and it certainly didn‚Äôt hurt to have the Posit organization promoting it too).\nAnd selfishly I must admit the effect of broadcasting the package far and wide is rewarding. Seeing the package featured on a blog post, or used in someone‚Äôs repository will make my day. Because it‚Äôs so cool to know the design choices I stayed awake thinking about were (possibly) appreciated by a fellow data enthusiast."

    "title": "A Great Summer of Great Tables",
    "section": "What I Learned",
    "text": "What I Learned\nThis summer touched on so many aspects of open source code, from the technical to the collaborative. I learned how to take an idea and turn it into a fully functioning Python package, and I gained hands-on experience with the whole development workflow. Beyond the code itself, I also learned the importance of communicating my work, whether through documentation, blog posts, or presentations.\n\nPackage Development\n\nBefore this summer, I had no idea what really went into making a Python package from scratch. I learned how to set everything up, from the folder structure, to setup files, to GitHub actions and beyond. I got comfortable with things like versioning, documentation, and publishing to PyPI. Now packaging up code feels way less mysterious and way more doable.\nThe open process taught me to write code that is readable and maintainable, not just functional. I also gained a deeper appreciation for documentation, not just as a reference, but as a way to welcome new users and contributors.\n\n\nDevelopment Organization\nWith a little shame, I must admit I never knew how to use a branch. That‚Äôs an exaggeration. I knew what a branch was, and I knew to make one so I didn‚Äôt have to commit to the main branch. The shameful part is once I had a branch, all the new code went into that. (üôà Don‚Äôt look at the repository for this website). And then one day, when I felt like there was probably too much code I hadn‚Äôt committed to the main branch, I‚Äôd merge it and ta-da, surely that was good enough‚Ä¶ right? Fortunately, I learned about how to separate code into isolated pieces, to then merge code in a way that keeps the project organized and maintainable.\nWith even more shame, I have to admit I didn‚Äôt know how to write a suite of tests. Again, I knew what tests were supposed to do, but the concept seemed like something meant for more professional environments, never for code that I worked on. Until my work became code that other people could theoretically rely on ‚Äì then I knew it had to be dependable. So from snapshot tests, to checking for the presence of css and html content, future changes and dependency upgrades can be relied on not to break the package.\nI‚Äôm not claiming to be a pro, but thanks to Rich and Michael‚Äôs mentoring, I am now much better at adhering to these practices than I used to be.\n\n\nWriting things like this!\n\nWhether it‚Äôs a blog post for me (this one!), a blog post for Great Tables or a blog post for the entirety of Posit, I have had no shortage of opportunities to talk about my work. As you might guess, this doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me, but it‚Äôs yet another skill I‚Äôve gotten to practice and hone in my summer at Posit.\nIn every instance (yes, even the slides), I‚Äôve presented my musings using Quarto markdown. I promise I‚Äôm not getting paid to say this, but having never used Quarto before this summer, I can confidently say I can‚Äôt imagine a life without it. Life with Quarto was especially easy when the team that maintains it was part of the organization I worked for :) which I‚Äôll definitely miss. Instead, I guess you‚Äôll find me lurking in GitHub issues."
